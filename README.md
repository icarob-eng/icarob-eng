### Hi there üëã

My name is √çcaro Bruno, I'm from Natal, Brasil. I really love physics, python and capybaras, as you can see in my project, [Capym - Capybara, Python, Mechanics](github.com/icarob-eng/capym). Why capybaras you ask? Good question. Just. Chill. Carrying on. That simulator helped me in some tutoring I gave in physics. Look at a some of what it can do:

Made with:

Besides capybaras and physics, I also think that microcontrollers are pretty cool, so i bought a Esp-8266 microcontroller and some relays to automate my house's lights. I could use Lua or C++ in the microcontoller, but why would I when theres is Micropython? The server software that I made is [this](github.com/icarob-eng/home-control-mc) and using my experience in Android Development I made a [client app](github.com/icarob-eng/home-control-client). It ain't much by now, in spite of that, slowly but surely, it will become a great project.

Above all of those little projects, the one I'm most proud of is [Montaigne ensaios](https://github.com/Montaigne-ensaios/montaigne_app) (Montaigne probing), an app thought to help engineers and building technicians (like me) to annotate and compile data from several types of soil test, like granulometry and Standard Penetration Test (SPT). It's the largest project that I have worked in, with a team of 9 developers from the Federal Institute of science and tecnology of Rio Grande do Norte (IFRN).

Another animal that I like are penguins. Unrelated to that, my beloved operational system is:

And the best programming languege is (for me at least):
